## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-26

### Changed

  - Replaced `pac --version` (non-existent flag) with bare `pac` invocation
  - Added installed version detection via `dotnet tool list --global`
  - Added latest version check against the NuGet API (`api.nuget.org`)
  - Added upgrade suggestion (`dotnet tool update --global Microsoft.PowerApps.CLI.Tool`) when installed version is outdated
  - Updated `SKILL.md` with three-case flow: not installed, outdated, and up to date
  - Removed incorrect `pac install latest` from all documentation

  - `skills/power-platform-connect/scripts/check-pac.sh` — executable script that checks for `pac` on PATH and reports version
- **Tag protection ruleset** (`protect-skill-tags`, ID `15567080`) — blocks update and deletion of tags matching `refs/tags/v*` with admin bypass ([plan 002](./archive/002-tag-protection.md))
- **Documentation**
  - `docs/setup.md` — repository structure, prerequisites, installation, agentskills.io spec reference, `gh` install link
  - `docs/skills.md` — catalog of all skills with frontmatter, activation triggers, bundled scripts, dependencies
